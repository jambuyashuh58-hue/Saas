# GarageFlow — Next.js Deployable Package

This is a minimal Next.js project generated from your single `garageflow-pro.jsx` file.

## Run locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deploy to Vercel
- Push this folder to a GitHub repo
- Import into Vercel
- **Root Directory**: leave blank (project root)
- Framework preset: **Next.js** (auto-detect)
- Deploy

If you ever move `pages/` into a subfolder, set that folder as **Root Directory** in Vercel settings.
